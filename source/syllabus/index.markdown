### Course Description

Through lectures, demonstrations, and hands on projects, students learn the basics of interactive publishing. Students create their own website and learn the basics of interactive design including HTML, CSS, javascript, and other industry web standards.

### Course Objectives

This course provides an overview of interactive design concepts and applications, with a specific focus on the web. Topics include:

- Structure of the Internet; hardware and software that make up the web
- HTML basics; document semantics, syntax, how to read it and write it
- Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
- Wireframing and user experience design (UX)
- Design for multiple devices - tablets, mobile phones, desktop browsers

### Course Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand the Internet’s structure and components
- Successfully identify key elements in the design of interactive applications
- Understand common practices and processes employed in the development of web applications
- Build a fully functional web site
- Understand responsive design techniques
- Contribute effectively to an iterative project workflow

### Course Format

- Daily standup - at the beginning of each class, we have a stand up meeting. You must be on time for this meeting, and you must participate. If you are not going to be able to make it, you must let me know ahead of time. (same as you would if we were all working in a studio, and I was your team lead)
- Demonstrations, class discussions, and critiques - On some days, I will demonstrate things on the projector, and you will follow along on your computer and ask me questions. On other days, your classmates will present their work for critique. You will critique it thoughtfully and compassionately.
- Homework Assignments - In many cases, your assignment will be some kind of project, either an individual or working in a group. Projects must be completed on time. If you are not going to complete a project on time, you must let your team know during standup. This is particularly important for group projects, but is a requirement for all projects.
 - In class projects - there will be a number of studio periods, during which time you will work individually or in groups, and I will help you as necessary. It is important that you make good use of this time - my observations of your focus (or lack thereof) during studio time will impact your professionalism and participation grades.

#### Assignments:

There are 3 main assignments:

1. Food Packaging as a Website (HTML and CSS specific)
2. Discovery and UX for final class project
3. Iterative design and code development for final class project

As well as 4 smaller assignments:

1. Successful/Unsuccessful website writeup
2. HTML version of the above
3. CSS Practice Worksheet
4. CSS Box Model Exercises

I realize that "final class project" is ambiguous. We are going to concept, design, and execute (to the best of our ability) an interactive application. We are going to work together to determine what this application will be. Since I have not met you at the time I’m writing this, it’s impossible to say what kind of application we are going to design.

### Course Evaluation

- Assignments 1-4: 5% Each
- Food Packaging Project: 20%
- Discovery and UX for final class project: 20%
- Final class project: 30%
- Participation: 5%
- Professionalism: 5%

### Department Policies

#### Professional Courtesy

Professionalism in the workplace is expressed through dependability and behavior that accords with high personal standards. Professionalism in the classroom is no different, but can be extended to include respect for the course itself, the process of learning, and mutual respect between students and the instructor. Respect for your peers can be as simple as waiting for another student to finish their observation or refraining from chatting while someone else is speaking.
 
Professionalism in the classroom includes:
- delivering thoughtful work on time
- interacting respectfully with professors and students
- participating productively in class discussions and group projects
- paying attention in class (no texting, no surfing)
- maintaining a record of punctual class attendance
- taking responsibility for poor work or missed deadlines

#### Attendance

Attendance is paramount, as lectures, in-class exercises, and class critiques cannot be replicated for absentees.

##### Absences

The only absences that will be excused are for illnesses requiring you to be in a doctor’s care (a note from your doctor must be provided), family emergencies, or jury duty.  Even in cases where absences are excused, if the maximum number of classes is missed (see below), withdrawal will be recommended due to the amount of in-class content missed. The following guidelines for penalizing grades due to unexcused absences will be applied:

Courses that meet ONCE per week:

2 absences = drop one grade (i.e. B+ to B); 3 absences = drop two grades (i.e. B+ to B-)

4 absences = failure or recommended withdrawal, meeting with the department Chair

Courses that meet TWICE per week:

3 absences = drop one grade (i.e. B+ to B); 5 absences = drop two grades (i.e. B+ to B-)

6 absences = failure or recommended withdrawal, meeting with the department Chair

##### Lateness

All classes begin when scheduled. Two late arrivals = one absence.

30 minutes late or 30 minutes leaving early = one absence.

### Grading

See the “Course evaluation” section above for an idea of the relative weights of the various assignments. Grading is a subjective process, but the main things I look for are: strength of conceptual work, overall effort, and execution and refinement of your final product. I will attempt to give you prompt feedback on all submitted work. If you disagree with my assessment of your work, feel free to talk with me about it, and I am happy to have a conversation about why you received the grade you did. Note that "having a conversation" and "Mark will change your grade if you complain" are not the same thing.

#### Grading System

A = 95 – 100%  
A- = 90 – 94%  
B+ = 85 – 89%  
B = 80 – 84%  
B- = 75 – 79%  
C+ = 70 – 74%  
C = 65 – 69%  
C- = 60 – 64%  
D+ = 55 – 59%  
D = 51 – 54%  
D- = 50%  
F = 49% and below  

#### Late Projects

Late projects will result in the following:

One day late = drop one grade; two days late = drop two grades; three days late = zero.

#### Retrieving Student Work

Students are responsible for retrieving their work. Students are expected to pick up all work handed in no later than three weeks after the official last day of classes. If work is not picked up, it will be assumed that the work is not wanted and will be discarded.

### College Support Resources

#### Student Affairs

Student Affairs is dedicated to enhancing and complementing students’ educational experience through programs, services and opportunities that aid in their personal development. Student Affairs is committed to community building, co-curricular learning, student support, and student involvement. If you are a student with a documented disability and you need accommodations, please make an appointment with the Director of Student Affairs to discuss these accommodations. All discussions will remain confidential. Call Student Affairs at 206/726-5003 for information.

#### Counseling

The mission of the Counseling Office (located in room 308) is to assist students with their academic and artistic pursuits by providing supportive counseling, referrals and outreach programs that promote students' mental health and emotional well being. To schedule an appointment, call a Counselor at 206/726-5027 or 206/726-5047. If they are not available, please leave a message on their voicemail and they will return your call as soon as possible.

#### Writing Center

The Writing Center is a free resource for all students who are interested in developing writing and reading skills. Located in room 311, the Writing Center is a place where students come to work on their writing and receive individual guidance, regardless of their level of development. Trained tutors are available to help students with such goals as: understanding assignments; brainstorming ideas; clear and cohesive prose; editing and revision strategies; crafting thesis statements; ESL resources. Contact Amanda Hill at 206/315-5806 or ahill@cornish.edu.

#### General Safety

Please inform yourself of safety procedures for this room, including emergency evacuation routes and the location of the closest first aid kits and fire extinguishers. Consult the Health & Safety Procedures booklet posted near doors and eyewash stations. Detailed information is also provided in the College student handbook.

## Weekly Course Schedule

### Week 1

**Tues 9/04** (First day of Fall Semester)

Introductions, class overview, syllabus review.  
Software setup.  
In-Class exercise:  Create a simple site that links 2 files.  

_Homework:_ "Basic Principles"  
Find two sites or applications that are examples of successful interactive design and two other sites which are not successful. Write a couple of paragraphs about each one detailing why you think it works or doesn't work. Type this up into an email and send it to me sometime before the start of class on Thursday.

Ask Yourself:

- What constitutes successful interactive design? Does it engage the user? Make them want to buy things? Make them want to participate?
- What are some interactive design features that should be avoided?
- What applications work? Why do they work? Are they easy to use? Are they fun?
- What applitcations fail? Why? Are they difficult to use? Do they not do anything useful?

**Thur 9/06**

Class Discussion: Successful sites, unsuccessful sites. View on projector and discuss.

Lecture: "HTML Intro" - tags, structure of document, semantics, etc.

_Homework:_

At a minimum, you should use several different header tags (\<h1\>, \<h2\>, etc), a link ("\<a\>" tag) to each of the sites you cite, paragraph (\<p\>) tags, etc. Your page should validate, and your use of tags should make sense semantically. Use the <img> tag to include a screenshot of each page you mention.

When you're done, zip everything into one file (your HTML page plus any image files you used) and submit it to me before the start of class on Tuesday. Make sure to name the zip file in a useful way - the department guidelines are ideal, but at a minimum, include your last name in the filename.

Class Discussion: Determine nature of final class project and teams. Discuss collaboration formats.

The final application needs to cover mobile web, tablet, as well as desktop use. It needs to have a fairly consistent interface and feature set across all three platforms, but it should also take advantage of the unique capabilities of each. We will be breaking into teams to work on the various aspects of the application, but the teams will need to remain in close contact with each other in order to keep the application cohesive. We may rotate people among the teams in order to ensure that each person gets input on each part of the application. We will discuss further.
