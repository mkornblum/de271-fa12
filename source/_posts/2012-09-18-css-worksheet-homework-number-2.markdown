Your homework for this week is below. Just like last week, download the HTML file, get a CSS file set up, and follow the instructions. This is due next Tuesday, September 25th.

**Note**: Yours does not have to look exactly like the example (in fact, I hope you make yours look better, or at least more "you".) The example is just meant to be the general idea of what you're going for.
