The video demonstration will be available here shortly. Example code is [available on Github](https://github.com/mkornblum/de271-fa12/tree/master/source/downloads/code/first-html-demo), or you can view it below. Remember that for your homework this week, you should include your text about each of the 4 sites, along with a working link to each site, and a screenshot of each site (use the \<img\> tag). Please let me know if you have any questions.
