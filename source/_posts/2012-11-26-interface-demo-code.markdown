Here's some HTML and CSS to help you get your links looking fancy. You'll need to download the code to try out the hover effects. The code can be found after the jump, or [on Github](https://github.com/mkornblum/de271-fa12/tree/master/source/downloads/code/interface-demos). Make sure you grab the image file as well, if you want the image example to work. 

{% img /images/examples/interface-1.png "Button Example" "Button Example" %}

{% include_code interface-demos/index.html %}
{% include_code interface-demos/style.css %}
