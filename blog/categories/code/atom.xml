Designed by Leo Fender, George Fullerton, and Freddie Tavares in 1954, it has been manufactured continuously by the Fender Musical Instruments Corporation to the present. It is a double-cutaway guitar, with an extended top horn for balance. Along with the Gibson Les Paul, it is one of the most popularly copied electric guitar shapes.&quot;Stratocaster&quot; and &quot;Strat&quot; are trademark terms belonging to Fender.<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>          <span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>Originally the Stratocaster was offered in a 2-color sunburst finish on a solid, deeply contoured ash body, a 21-fret one-piece maple neck with black dot inlays and Kluson tuning heads. In 1956 Fender began issuing solid Stratocasters with alder bodies. In 1960 the available custom colors were standardized, many of which were automobile lacquer colors from Dupont available at an additional 5% cost. The unique single-ply, 8-screw hole white pickguard allowed all electronic components-except the recessed jack plate-to be attached to it for easy assembly. Despite subsequent Stratocaster models (including copies) vintage Fender models are highly valued by collectors for their investment potential and players who prefer the timbre of older models.<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>Its simple yet effective design and revolutionary sound broke ground and set trends in electric guitar manufacturing and popular music. Introduced for national distribution as the Broadcaster in the autumn of 1950, it was the first guitar of its kind produced on a substantial scale. Its commercial production can be traced as far back as March 1950, when the single- and dual-pickup Esquire models were first sold. The Telecaster has been in continuous production in one form or another since its first incarnation. The Fender Telecaster has been mostly used in music genres such as country and rock, but is also sometimes used in jazz.<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

The Les Paul was designed by Ted McCarty in collaboration with popular guitarist Les Paul, whom Gibson enlisted to endorse the new model. It is one of the most well-known electric guitar types in the world, along with the Fender Stratocaster and Telecaster.<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>The Gibson Les Paul was the result of a design collaboration between Gibson Guitar Corporation and the late jazz guitarist and electronics inventor Les Paul. In 1950, with the introduction of the Fender Telecaster to the musical market, electric guitars became a public craze. In reaction, Gibson Guitar president Ted McCarty brought guitarist Les Paul into the company as a consultant. Les Paul was a respected innovator who had been experimenting with guitar design for years to benefit his own music. In fact, he had hand-built a solid-body prototype called &quot;The Log&quot;, a design widely considered the first solid-body Spanish guitar ever built, as opposed to the &quot;Hawaiian&quot;, or lap-steel guitar. This guitar is known as &quot;The Log&quot; because the solid core is a pine block whose width and depth are a little more than the width of the fretboard. Although numerous other prototypes and limited-production solid-body models by other makers have since surfaced, it is known that in 1945-1946, Les Paul had approached Gibson with &quot;The Log&quot; prototype, but his solid body design was rejected.<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

Designed by Leo Fender, George Fullerton, and Freddie Tavares in 1954, it has been manufactured continuously by the Fender Musical Instruments Corporation to the present. It is a double-cutaway guitar, with an extended top horn for balance. Along with the Gibson Les Paul, it is one of the most popularly copied electric guitar shapes.&quot;Stratocaster&quot; and &quot;Strat&quot; are trademark terms belonging to Fender.<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>Originally the Stratocaster was offered in a 2-color sunburst finish on a solid, deeply contoured ash body, a 21-fret one-piece maple neck with black dot inlays and Kluson tuning heads. In 1956 Fender began issuing solid Stratocasters with alder bodies. In 1960 the available custom colors were standardized, many of which were automobile lacquer colors from Dupont available at an additional 5% cost.
